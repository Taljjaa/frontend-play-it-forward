# PlayItForward - Frontend

PlayItForward is a web app that aims to incentivize volunteers to contribute to their community through gamification

[This](https://github.com/Taljjaa/backend-play-it-forward) is a link to the backend repository.

## Motivation

PlayItForward was an idea me and my fellow Flatiron classmates came up with for DemocracyLab's HackToGiveThanks Hackathon. The premise was tech for good and we really wanted something that would solve a problem. Volunteering is a great way to meet people, gain real world experience, and help your community. We are taught the values of volunteering but most don't actually volunteer. Only when we are required to volunteer for something like community service or college applications. By rewarding volunteers with points when they sign up for events we can encourage people to start volunteering and keep them engaged. PlayItForward aims to be the perfect site for finding all local upcoming events and finding new organizations to volunteer with.
